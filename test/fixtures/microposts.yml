# Note that we have explicitly set the created_at column using embedded Ruby.
# Because it’s a “magic” column automatically updated by Rails, setting it by
# hand isn’t ordinarily possible, but it is possible in fixtures. In practice
# this might not be necessary, and in fact on many systems the fixtures are
# created in order. In this case, the final fixture in the file is created last
# (and hence is most recent), but it would be foolish to rely on this behavior,
# which is brittle and probably system-dependent.
